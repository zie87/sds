This project contains example implementations of data structurs for text 
sequences. This structurs are manly based on the structur description in the 
paper [Data Structures for Text Sequences](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crowley/papers/sds.pdf).
You can find a copy of the document in the 'doc'-directory.

The folder 'neatpad' contains the piece-chain implementation from [Neatpad](http://www.catch22.net/tuts/neatpad). 
You can find a description of the implementation [here](http://www.catch22.net/tuts/piece-chains). 
This directory contains a subfolder with the name 'linux_port'. The code in 
this folders is nearly the same like the original one. Only the Windows specific 
parts are removed and the source is split into multiple modules.
